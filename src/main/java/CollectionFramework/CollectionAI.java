/**
 * The Java Collection Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces that implement various types of collections, 
 * such as lists, sets, and maps. It is part of the java.util package and helps manage groups of objects
 * 
 *  Key Interfaces:
List: An ordered collection that can contain duplicate elements.
Example: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.

Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
Example: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

Queue: A collection used for holding elements prior to processing.
Example: PriorityQueue, LinkedList.

Map: A collection that maps keys to values, with no duplicate keys.
Example: HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, Hashtable.

Deque: A double-ended queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
Example: ArrayDeque, LinkedList
_______________________________________________________________
 * 
 * Key Classes:
ArrayList: Implements the List interface and provides a dynamic array that grows as needed.
HashMap: Implements the Map interface and stores data in key-value pairs with no order guaranteed.

HashSet: Implements the Set interface and provides a collection that does not allow duplicates and has no ordering.
LinkedList: Implements both the List and Deque interfaces, 
providing functionality to add and remove elements from both ends of the list.
