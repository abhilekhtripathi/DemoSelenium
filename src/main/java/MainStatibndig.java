}
//Static Methods: Both Vehicle and Car have a static method named display().
//Static Binding: When myVehicle.display() is called, it refers to the Vehicle classâ€™s display() method
//because static binding occurs at compile time, based on the reference type (Vehicle), not the actual object type (Car).

//Static binding (also known as early binding) occurs when the method to be executed is determined at compile time. 
//This typically happens with static methods, final methods, and private methods.
