1. What is SQL and why is it used?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
It is used for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in databases.

2. What are the different types of SQL commands?
SQL commands are divided into five categories:
DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT
DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE
TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT


3. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
WHERE: Filters rows before grouping.
HAVING: Filters groups after aggregation.

4. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN?
INNER JOIN: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
OUTER JOIN: Returns matching rows and unmatched rows from one or both tables.
SELF JOIN : A self join is not a special type of join; it is just a way to use an existing join (like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) on the same table.


5. How do you retrieve unique records from a table?
Answer: Use DISTINCT.
SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;


6. How do you find duplicate records in a table?

SELECT name, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM employees
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;



7. How do you fetch the second-highest salary?

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);


8. What are sub-queries, and how are they used?
A sub-query is a query nested inside another query.

Example: Find employees with the highest salary in their department.

SELECT * 
FROM employees e
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) 
                FROM employees 
                WHERE department_id = e.department_id);


9. Explain the difference between UNION and UNION ALL.
UNION: Combines results from two queries and removes duplicates.
UNION ALL: Combines results from two queries without removing duplicates.
Example:

SELECT name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT name FROM contractors;


10. How do you perform pagination in SQL?
Pagination retrieves a subset of records.

Example: Fetch the second page with 10 rows per page.

SELECT * 
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

11.Keys differences  
Key Type	(Uniqueness)	(NULLs Allowed)	(Purpose)
Primary Key	    Yes	       No	              Uniquely identifies a row.
Foreign Key  	No	       Yes(Nullable)	  Establishes relationships between tables.
Unique Key	    Yes	       Yes(One NULL)	  Ensures unique values but not as primary key.
Candidate Key	Yes	       No	              Potential primary keys.
Composite Key	Yes	       No	              Combination of columns as primary key.
Alternate Key	Yes	       No	              A candidate key not chosen as the primary key.
