	/**
	 * I am working  a automation testing framework using Selenium with Java, 
	 * leveraging Maven for dependency management and TestNG for test execution. 
	 * The framework follows the Page Object Model design pattern, ensuring modularity and reusability. 
	 * It supports data-driven testing, where test data is stored in external files like Excel 
	 * and fed into tests using TestNG’s @DataProvider. The framework is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, 
	 * allowing automated tests to run with every build. This ensures continuous testing and quick feedback. Additionally, 
	 * the framework supports parallel execution and cross-browser testing, making it scalable and efficient. Overall, 
	 * it has helped us improve test coverage, reduce manual effort, and deliver high-quality software."
	 * 
	 * Key Components of the Framework:----
	 *  Page Object Model (POM)
	 *  TestNG for Test case's Management
	 *  Data-Driven concept for managing the test data
	 *  Reporting for view test cases report 
	 *  Reusable/driver Utilities
	 *  CI/CD Integration	>>  Framework runs in Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps
	 * 

	 *      4. How the Framework Works (Execution Flow)
	 *      
1️>> Test case execution starts (via TestNG or Maven command)
2>> Driver initialization (Based on browser configuration)
3>> Test scripts interact with web elements (Using Selenium WebDriver)
4️>> Assertions validate expected results (Pass/Fail)
5>> Results, logs, and screenshots are captured
6️>> Reports are generated and stored
7>>Integration with CI/CD triggers execution automatically
