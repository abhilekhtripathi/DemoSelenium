	 * "Our Selenium framework is a robust test automation solution designed using 
	 * Java, Selenium WebDriver, Page Object Model (POM), TestNG, Data-Driven Testing, and Reporting. 
	 * The framework is modular, scalable, and ensures separation of concerns, making it maintainable and reusable."
	 * 
	 * Key Components of the Framework:----
	 *  Page Object Model (POM)
	 *  TestNG for Test case's Management
	 *  Data-Driven concept for managing the test data
	 *  Reporting for view test cases report 
	 *  Reusable/driver Utilities
	 *  
	 *  This framework is modular, extensible, and designed to handle complex testing requirements. 
	 *  It enables high test coverage, faster debugging through detailed reports, 
	 *  and easy integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing."

	 * 1. Introduction
        "An automation testing framework is a structured approach to writing and executing test scripts efficiently. 
        Our framework, built using Selenium and Java, provides a scalable, reusable, and maintainable solution for testing web applications."
        
                   2. Key Components of the Framework
                            
        Selenium WebDriver  >>	    with web browsers to automate actions
        Java  >>	                Programming language used for writing test scripts
        TestNG/JUnit  >> 	        Manages test execution, assertions, and reporting
        Page Object Model (POM)>>  	A java design  pattern for maintaining test scripts
        Data-Driven Testing	>>      Uses Excel, JSON, or Properties files for input data
                Maven/Gradle	 >> Manages dependencies and builds
                    Log4j	 >>    Captures logs for debugging
      ChainTest  Reports/Allure  >>	Generates execution reports
          CI/CD Integration	   >>  Framework runs in Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 *      4. How the Framework Works (Execution Flow)
	 *      
1️>> Test case execution starts (via TestNG or Maven command)
2>> Driver initialization (Based on browser configuration)
3>> Test scripts interact with web elements (Using Selenium WebDriver)
4️>> Assertions validate expected results (Pass/Fail)
5>> Results, logs, and screenshots are captured
6️>> Reports are generated and stored
7>>Integration with CI/CD triggers execution automatically
